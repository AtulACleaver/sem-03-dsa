2. Write a C program or algorithm to evaluate a postfix expression using a stack. Demonstrate the step-by-step evaluation of the expression "534*+2-" based on your implementation. Clearly illustrate each intermediate step and the contents of the stack at each stage of the evaluation. 

algo postfix_evaluation(postfix_exp)
    1. create stack[], top = -1
    2. while(postfix_exp != '\0')
        2.1. if(operand)
            2.1.1. push operand into stack
        2.2 else if(operator)
            2.2.1 set temp = pop(stack)
            2.2.2 stack[top] = stack[top] (operator) temp
    3. Final result = stack[top]
    4. Stop & Exit
