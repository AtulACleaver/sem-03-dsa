7. If the node of a doubly linked list is declared in C as:
```c
struct node {
    int data;
    struct node *prev;
    struct node *next; 
};
```
and `ptr` is a pointer pointing to one of the internal nodes of a doubly linked list, then write the required statements to delete the node to which `ptr` is pointing to without using any other pointer variable.

ptr->prev->next = ptr->next
ptr->next->prev = ptr->prev
free(ptr)
