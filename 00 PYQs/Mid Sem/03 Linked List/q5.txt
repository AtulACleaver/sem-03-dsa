5. Write an algorithm/ C function to insert a node after a specific position in a doubly linked list, where previous pointer is named as `prev` and the next pointer is named as `next`. `head` is a pointer variable holding the address of the first node of the list, which is passed as the argument to the function.

algo insert_after_pos_dll(head, pos)
1. Create new_node
2. if new_node == NULL
       Display "Overflow"
       return
3. new_node->data = scan data
4. new_node->next = NULL
   new_node->prev = NULL
5. if head == NULL
       if pos == 0
            head = new_node
            return
       else
            Display "Position does not exist"
            return
6. ptr = head
7. count = 0
8. while count < pos and ptr->next != NULL
       ptr = ptr->next
       count = count + 1
9. if count < pos
       Display "Position out of range"
       return
10. new_node->next = ptr->next
11. new_node->prev = ptr
12. if ptr->next != NULL
        ptr->next->prev = new_node
13. ptr->next = new_node
14. End
