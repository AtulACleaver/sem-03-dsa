1. A single linked list contains n nodes. What is the time complexity of reversing this list in-place?
2. Write a recursive C function to print all the elements present in a single linked list in reverse order.
3. Consider the following function applied to a single
    linked list with odd no. of nodes:
    struct node * fun ()
    struct node *p, *g;
    p=q=start;// start points to the first node of the list
    while(q!=NULL && q->next!=NULL)
    9=q-> next-> next;
    p=p->next;
    }
    return p;
    }

    The code will return _ node of the list.
    (A) Last node
    (B) Node before the last node
    (C) Middle node
    (D) None of options
